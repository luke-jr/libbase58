Installation
--------------------
# Install libgcrypt first, e.g. via `brew install libgcrypt` on OS X or libgcrypt-dev on Linux
# Generate the final build scripts
./autogen.sh
# Build the CLI and library
./configure && make

Dependencies
--------------------
Many of the test scripts depend on the "xxd" tool to convert between hexadecimal and binary.
If this tool is not installed on your Operating System, you can probably get it as part of
the "vim" editor from https://www.vim.org/ or by installing the vim-share package.

Troubleshooting
--------------------
If libgcrypt isn't found after install, set AM_PATH_LIBGCRYPT env var to libgcrypt path
prior to running autogen.sh. For example, on OS X with ver 1.7.6:

export AM_PATH_LIBGCRYPT="/usr/local/Cellar/libgcrypt/1.7.6/lib"
